# Profile Card App

- This is a simple profile card application.
- This application has two sections, first (Profile Card) section will be dynamically updated, and in second (Update Profile) section user will give inputs.
- Initially everything will be blank, when the user write his/her name, age and description in input fields, immediately it will be displayed in the Profile Card section.
- This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.5.
